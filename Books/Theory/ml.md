# Machine Learning (ML)

A process in which machine learns from data (inputs and past experience) and from this predict the next set of outcomes is called MAchine learning.

Traffic Signal Example:\
<span style=color:red> Red = data </span>\
<span style=color:yellow> Yellow=Learning predicitions </span>\
<span style=color:green> Green = Decisions </span>

**Data   Driven** = Training\
**Decision  Making** = Prediction

Naan tiki ki misaal (10 wala maal 9 me  bechne me sochta raha .. gaahak chala gyaa ) it show data driven decision making poor thi.\

1. _Data Driven_
   * Data should be moderate. Not too excess not to less and clean also.
   * Data can be trained to develop a model and model can then be used for prediction _(Decision Making)_.
  
# Types of Machine Learning

## Supervised 
* works under supervision
* Teacher teaches
* Prediction and then outcome
  
  80-20 Rule:
  * Teach with 80 percent data. Check whether it learnt by testing with 20 percent data.
    * (Woh bachay ko mehmano k samne baba bulwana is testing)
  * then unknown inputs p output predict karo.

### Types of Supervised Learning
#### Classification
* For categories based 
#### Regression
* For numeric data

## Unsupervised Learning
* No supervision = no testing
* No teacher = **NO ip exist**
* No labelling of data
* It finds pattern by itself
  
Example:
 Like 100 bache dedeye 10 aur 5 class k mix. Ab apne Q/As banae according to class 10.\
 Those who will answer will be assigned cluster of class 10. Those who will not go to cluster of class 5. and nallay bech k will go to third cluster.\
 There input was absent. You just did clustering.

 ## Semi Supervised
 * Mixture of 1 and 2. (Some labelled and unlabelled data)
 * Some data is labelled most is not.

**Thora data supervised wala thora clustering wala (without ip and label)**
_Mostly data is with Missing Value_

## Reinforcement Learning
* Hit and Trial
* Learn from Mistakes
* Reward and Punishment rule
* Prediction based on Reward and Punishment.

Input data dia (but it is not a training data)\
Model will learn itself (like footballer knows foul par red card mil jana,     use batana nahe parta)\
**Example: First ane par gift milta hay tu ap automatically train hojate ho k mjhe parhna hay ab se**\
Matlab supervised me sutta pene par warning
Reinforcement me sutta piya tu direct pitay tu next time saza par learn kia. _**((Feedback))**_
