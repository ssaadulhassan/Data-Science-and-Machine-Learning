## 1. Completely Randomized Design (CRD)
 Each experimental unit is randomly assigned to one of the treatments.
 _**Example**_:

goat food(1&2) (Chara) is to be checked on goats. 
Total goats=20

2 samples of 10 each

and then telling result on the basis of these samples k food 1 and food 2 ka kia impact hay. food 1 will be compared with food2 





## 2. Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD)
Two step process

* Make the block
* Then repeat the CRD 

_**Example:**_

* Same 20 goats hayn.
* 2 sample of 10 males and 10 females.
* Phir un 10 male and female me further 5 5 k samples. Like male me 5 will get Food 1 and 5 will get food 2. Similar for female goats.
* Repeat CRD on this sample

Yahan 1 factor is food and other is gender.

## 3. Latin Square Design (LSD)
Similar to square (rows= columns)

 0  | Week 1  | Week 2  | Week 3 |
| -------- | ----------- | ------ | ------|
| Goat 1 | Food 1 | Food 2| Food3
| Goat 2 | Food 3 | Food 1 | Food 2
| Goat 3  | Food 2 | Food 3 | Food 1

No repititions of treatment in rows and columns.

Used in less resources.
